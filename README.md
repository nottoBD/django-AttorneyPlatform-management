## Preamble

This project is the final thesis of our IT Bachelor's degree. It was commissioned by Attorney Soetaert, a family law attorney and Director of the Jurinet Law firm in Brussels, responsible for its family law branch, Neok.

We have built a complete platform for parents, lawyers, and judges based on the real-life experiences and work processes of our client. The platform uses Python, Django, Bootstrap, a little bit of JavaScript, Brevo's SMTP servers and PostgreSQL.

The entire life cycle of the project has been handled: we developed, secured, put it into production, managed the infrastructure, and ensured compliance with GDPR and the laws in Belgium.

The project is fully open-source and does not use any analytics or collect any data beyond what is necessary for its basic functionality.
